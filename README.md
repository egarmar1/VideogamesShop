Videogames shop is a fictional website, where you can buy different videogames.
This is the first look of the website:

On the left of the web page we can either login, or register.
In the register form we introduce our info, of course there are some checks in the backend so that the email doesnt exists, the name isn't numeric...
Optionally we can add a profile photo.

After succesfully registering we login with that user:

Now that we are logged we can buy any game that is in the web. Further more we can clasify by categories:

Then there's the shopping cart:
